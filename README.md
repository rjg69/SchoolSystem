# Savvior School System
Generated a school system using PHP and HTML/CSS that could carry out basic tracking of students, classes, room assignments, and books. The purpose of this project was to familiarize onesself with the tools and programs to be used throughout the rest of my time as a co-op at Savvior as well as expand one's understanding of the languages necessary. Approximate completion time: TBD
