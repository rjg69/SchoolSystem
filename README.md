# Savvior School System
Generated a school system using PHP, Javascript, and HTML/CSS that could carry out basic tracking of students, classes, room assignments, and books. The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with the tools and programs to be used throughout the rest of my time as a co-op at Savvior as well as expand my understanding of the languages necessary for upcoming projects. 

Approximate assignment requirement completion time: 4 weeks

Additional improvements were made to this project following the 4-week completion date in order to continue exploring the capabilities of PHP, MySQL, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
